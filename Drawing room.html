            <H1> MY DRAWING ROOM</H1>
            <p>My drawing room is a warm and welcoming space that blends comfort with style.<br> The furniture is arranged to encourage easy conversation, with plush seating and a beautifully crafted coffee table at the center. 
            Soft, ambient lighting adds a cozy feel, while thoughtful accents like artwork and decorative cushions bring a touch of personality. <br>
            Large windows let in plenty of natural light during the day, creating a bright and airy atmosphere, while in the evenings, it becomes a tranquil retreat perfect for relaxation or hosting friends.</p>
